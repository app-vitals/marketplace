## Scenario 1: Plan Session — Node.js (pnpm)

### Setup
1. Create a test repo with `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and basic `src/` structure
2. Add `src/components/`, `src/api/`, `src/lib/` directories
3. Create `planning/test-feature/` with a requirements doc

### Run
```
/plan-session test-feature
```

### Verify
- [ ] Phase 0 detects pnpm as package manager
- [ ] Phase 0 reads package.json scripts correctly
- [ ] Phase 3 auto-detects layers: Frontend, API, Shared
- [ ] Phase 4 generates planning doc with correct template
- [ ] Phase 4 uses detected layers (not Chrome extension layers)
- [ ] Phase 5 quality checks all pass
- [ ] Phase 7 generates correct pnpm permission patterns
- [ ] No Chrome extension references anywhere in output
- [ ] No hardcoded `pnpm validate` — uses detected commands

---

## Scenario 2: Plan Session — Python (poetry)

### Setup
1. Create a test repo with `pyproject.toml` (poetry build system), `poetry.lock`
2. Add `src/api/`, `src/db/`, `src/lib/` directories
3. Create `planning/test-feature/` with a requirements doc

### Run
```
/plan-session test-feature
```

### Verify
- [ ] Phase 0 detects Poetry as package manager
- [ ] Phase 0 identifies pytest, ruff check commands
- [ ] Phase 3 auto-detects layers: API, Database, Shared
- [ ] Phase 7 generates poetry/pytest permission patterns
- [ ] Planning doc template uses correct Python toolchain

---

## Scenario 3: Plan Session — Rust (cargo)

### Setup
1. Create a test repo with `Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`
2. Add `src/cli/`, `src/lib/` directories
3. Create `planning/test-feature/` with a requirements doc

### Run
```
/plan-session test-feature
```

### Verify
- [ ] Phase 0 detects Cargo
- [ ] Phase 0 identifies `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`
- [ ] Phase 3 auto-detects layers: CLI, Shared
- [ ] Phase 7 includes `Bash(cargo:*)` permission
- [ ] Planning doc references cargo commands (not pnpm)

---

## Scenario 4: Dev Task — Single Execution

### Setup
1. Complete Scenario 1 (have a planning doc with tasks)
2. Identify the first available task ID

### Run
```
/dev-task {TASK-ID}
```

### Verify
- [ ] Step 0 detects toolchain
- [ ] Step 1 finds the planning doc
- [ ] Step 2 extracts all task fields correctly
- [ ] Step 3 checks dependencies
- [ ] Step 4 marks task [🔨] and commits
- [ ] Step 6 creates feature branch from main
- [ ] Step 7 implements using inline workflow (not /feature-dev)
- [ ] Step 8 runs simplification pass (not /simplify)
- [ ] Step 9 verifies acceptance criteria
- [ ] Step 10 runs detected validation commands (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Step 11 creates PR with correct body format
- [ ] Step 12 shows handoff block (standalone mode)

---

## Scenario 5: Dev Task — Merge Mode

### Setup
Same as Scenario 4

### Run
```
/dev-task {TASK-ID} --merge
```

### Verify
- [ ] All pause points are skipped
- [ ] Step 12 runs inline review (not /review command)
- [ ] Review uses generic Agent types (not pr-review-toolkit)
- [ ] PR is squash-merged automatically
- [ ] Planning doc status updated to [x] PR #{N}
- [ ] Learning capture only runs if learning-loop plugin is installed

---

## Scenario 6: Dev Loop

### Setup
1. Have a planning doc with 3+ tasks, first 2 with no dependencies
2. Third task depends on first two

### Run
```
/dev-loop test-feature
```

### Verify
- [ ] Phase 0 locates planning doc
- [ ] Phase 1 picks first available task
- [ ] Phase 2 launches subagent with /dev-task --merge
- [ ] Phase 3 confirms completion, loops to next task
- [ ] Dependency chain respected (task 3 runs after 1 and 2)
- [ ] Loop ends with COMPLETE or BLOCKED summary
- [ ] Permission cleanup offered if pipeline-permissions-added.json exists

---

## Scenario 7: Review — Standalone

### Setup
1. Complete a /dev-task (without --merge) to have a branch with PR
2. Switch to a new session on the feature branch

### Run
```
/review
```

### Verify
- [ ] Step 0 detects toolchain
- [ ] Step 1 auto-detects branch and PR
- [ ] Step 2 recovers task ID from branch name
- [ ] Step 3 gathers context in parallel
- [ ] Step 4 launches appropriate agents based on diff analysis
- [ ] Step 4 uses feature-dev:code-reviewer and general-purpose agents (not pr-review-toolkit)
- [ ] Step 5 validates findings against source files
- [ ] Step 5b runs coverage with detected commands
- [ ] Step 6 evaluates acceptance criteria
- [ ] Step 7 presents structured report
- [ ] Step 8 fixes use detected validation commands
- [ ] Step 11 learning capture is conditional on plugin availability

---

## Scenario 8: Refresh Plan

### Setup
1. Have a planning doc with some [x] and some [ ] tasks
2. Modify some source files referenced by [ ] tasks (move or rename)

### Run
```
/refresh-plan test-feature
```

### Verify
- [ ] Step 1 loads and parses the planning doc
- [ ] Step 2 identifies [ ] tasks correctly
- [ ] Step 3 detects stale file paths
- [ ] Step 3 checks dependency status updates
- [ ] Step 4 proposes correct changes
- [ ] Step 5 shows before/after diff
- [ ] Step 6 commits after user approval

---

## Anti-Pattern Checks

Run these across ALL scenarios to verify genericization:

- [ ] No references to "Chrome extension", "WXT", "MV3", "content script", "service worker lifecycle"
- [ ] No hardcoded `pnpm validate`, `pnpm -r check` — uses detected commands
- [ ] No hardcoded `cargo clippy`, `cargo test` — uses detected commands
- [ ] No references to hardcoded packages like "extension", "desktop", "packages/shared"
- [ ] No `/feature-dev` skill invocation — replaced with inline implementation
- [ ] No `/simplify` skill invocation — replaced with inline simplification
- [ ] No `pr-review-toolkit:*` agent types — replaced with generic agents
- [ ] No required `Skill(learn)` or `Skill(learning-loop:learn-promote)` — optional only
- [ ] No hardcoded coverage threshold of 90% — uses configurable threshold (default 80%)
- [ ] No `frontend-design` as required — optional Design Skill tag
- [ ] No hardcoded layer names "Background/UI/Content Script/Shared" — uses auto-detected layers
